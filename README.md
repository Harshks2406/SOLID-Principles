In this repository, I have explained about SOLID Principles.

SOLID stands for: 
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

I have taken examples of code and shown what are the problems with them and have given the soultions on the basis of SOLID Principles.
